<h3> H<sub>2 </sub> O </h3>
<p>Water (H2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue.
 This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the "universal solvent" for its ability to dissolve many substances.[14][15] This allows it to be the "solvent of life".
[16] It is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in nature.[17]
Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other and are strongly polar. 
This polarity allows it to separate ions in salts and strongly bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids, thus dissolving them. 
Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively high boiling point of 100 Â°C for its molar mass, and a high heat capacity.
<h1><i><u> SUPERSCRIPT</u></i> </h1>
<h3> (a<sup>2 </sup> + b<sup>2 </sup>) = (a<sup>2 </sup> + b<sup>2 </sup>+2ab) </h3>
<p>Note the square built on the hypotenuse of the triangle below: The square has an area of c2, which the Pythagorean theorem says is equal to a2 + b2. 
But that is exactly the right hand side of our original inequality. </p>
